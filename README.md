# gps-navigation-simulator
GPS Navigation Simulator is a web-based application that demonstrates shortest-path routing using Dijkstra’s algorithm and visualizes real-time navigation on an interactive map. The project integrates OpenStreetMap with Leaflet and supports live device location tracking for real-world GPS simulation.
